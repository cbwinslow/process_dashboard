# OpenAI Codex Tasks for Process Dashboard

## High Priority

- [in-progress by Codex] Refactor and modularize the dashboard UI for easier extension and testing.
- [in-progress by Codex] Improve test coverage for all UI and monitoring modules (see `src/ui/`, `src/monitoring/`).
- [in-progress by Codex] Implement robust error handling and user feedback for all configuration panels.
- [in-progress by Codex] Integrate AI orchestrator and optimizer agents with the main dashboard loop.
