# Process Dashboard Maintenance Guide

## Automated Maintenance

### Setup Automated Maintenance

Run the maintenance setup script:
```bash
./scripts/maintenance/setup_maintenance.sh
```

This will:
1. Install maintenance scripts
2. Configure cron jobs
3. Set up log rotation
4. Configure automated checks

### Default Schedule

- Log Rotation: Daily at 1 AM
- Performance Check: Every 6 hours
- Security Scan: Daily at 2 AM
- Cleanup: Weekly on Sunday at 3 AM

## Manual Maintenance

### Log Management

```bash
# Rotate logs manually
./scripts/maintenance/rotate_logs.sh

# View recent logs
tail -f ~/.local/share/process-dashboard/logs/dashboard.log

# Check log sizes
du -sh ~/.local/share/process-dashboard/logs/
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Check current performance
./scripts/maintenance/check_performance.sh

# Monitor real-time
watch -n 5 ./scripts/maintenance/check_performance.sh
```

### Security

```bash
# Run security scan
./scripts/maintenance/security_scan.sh

# Check file permissions
ls -la ~/.local/share/process-dashboard/
```

### System Cleanup

```bash
# Run cleanup
./scripts/maintenance/cleanup.sh

# Check disk usage
du -sh ~/.local/share/process-dashboard/
```
